    "2. You can see the value in the list `numbers` at index `i` each time through the loop, and how that value changes when it is increased by adding `i`.\n",
    "3. The value that changes in the list `numbers` in each iteration through this for loop is the value at index `i`, while the other values are not updated. This occurs because we're assigning a new value at `numbers[i]`.\n",
    "4. Note that the values for `numbers[i]` on the right side of the equation is the \"old\" value. That \"old\" value is increased by `i` first, and then stored as the updated value `numbers[i]`.\n",

    "### Why use index values to loop over a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question. First off, if you want to update individual values in a list you're likely going to need a loop that includes the index values. There are functions such as `enumerate()` that can help, but their use can be somewhat confusing for new programmers. Second, in cases where you have multiple lists that are related to one another, it can be handy to use a loop with the index values to be able to access corresponding locations in each list. For this, let's consider an example with the two lists below."
